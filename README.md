### Quick Start

> Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/wiki) for complete documentation.

Havoc works well on Debian 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 and Kali Linux. It's recommended to use the latest versions possible to avoid issues. You'll need a modern version of Qt and Python 3.10.x to avoid build issues.

See the [Installation](https://havocframework.com/docs/installation) docs for instructions. If you run into issues, check the [Known Issues](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/wiki#known-issues) page as well as the open/closed [Issues](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/issues) list.

### What's New in 0.9 "Warden's Eye"

A collection of operator experience and agent capability improvements. Full details and revert instructions are in [`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md).

#### WPAD Full URL Fix (HVC-027)

- Fixed a pre-existing bug where `WinHttpGetProxyForUrl` received a bare URI path (e.g. `/beacon`) instead of a full URL (e.g. `https://c2.example.com:443/beacon`).
- The function requires a fully-qualified URL so WPAD/PAC scripts can evaluate the request destination; passing a path caused both DHCP/DNS auto-detect and PAC file fallback to silently fail on every beacon.
- The fix assembles the correct URL from `Config.Transport.Secure`, `Host->Host`, `Host->Port`, and `HttpEndpoint` using only `MemCopy` and integer arithmetic — no stdlib dependency.

#### Auto Proxy Detection (HVC-026)

- Demon agents now detect and use the Windows system proxy at startup rather than lazily on the first beacon send.
- A new "Auto Proxy Detection" checkbox (on by default) in the payload builder lets operators enable or disable the feature per payload.
- When enabled, the agent reads `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings` directly via Advapi32 (no WinHTTP dependency) to extract `ProxyServer`, strips the `http=` protocol prefix from multi-protocol strings, and sets `Proxy.Url` before the first beacon. If no registry proxy is found, the WinHTTP WPAD/IE fallback still fires on the first connect — and with HVC-027 applied, that WPAD lookup now works correctly.

#### Listener Column in Session Table (HVC-025)

- The agent session table now includes a "Listener" column showing which listener each agent is using, making it easier to manage deployments with multiple active listeners.

#### Listener Dialog Theming (HVC-024)

- The Listener configuration dialog now fully adapts to dark and light theme switches, using `ThemeManager` colours for background, text, accent borders, and scroll areas.

#### Last-Checkin Time Fixes (HVC-023)

- Fixed three bugs that caused the "last checkin" column to display incorrect elapsed times: timezone mismatch between server (Go `time.Now()`) and client (Qt local time), CDN transit latency absorbed into the server-side timestamp, and a deprecated `QDateTime::fromTime_t` day-count calculation.

### What's New in 0.8 "Silent Storm"

This release focuses on hardening the HTTP(S) transport layer against network-level detection and packet analysis. All changes are applied to the Demon agent and the teamserver; the client and SMB transport are unaffected. Full details and revert instructions are in [`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md).

#### Removed Teamserver Fingerprint Header (HVC-001)

- Removed the `X-Havoc: true` response header that was returned on every rejected HTTP request. This header made the teamserver trivially identifiable by passive scanners and IDS rules matching the response.

#### Base64-Encoded HTTP Bodies (HVC-002)

- All HTTP POST bodies sent by the Demon are now Base64-encoded before transmission; the teamserver decodes them before parsing.
- The teamserver Base64-encodes all responses before writing them to the wire; the Demon decodes them after reading.
- A compact RFC 4648 Base64 encode/decode implementation was added to the Demon (`MiniStd.c`) with no CRT dependency.
- Applies to both the HTTP listener (`http.go`) and the External C2 handler (`external.go`).
- Raw binary POST bodies are immediately anomalous to DPI systems. Base64 payloads are indistinguishable from the token fields and encoded data that appear routinely in legitimate web traffic.

#### Obfuscated Outer Packet Header (HVC-003)

- The 20-byte outer packet header contains the static value `0xDEADBEEF` at a fixed byte offset in every POST body. This was the single highest-confidence network IDS signature for Havoc traffic.
- The four header fields that follow the SIZE field (magic value, agent ID, command ID, request ID — bytes 4–19) are now XOR-masked before transmission using a mask derived from the packet SIZE field: `mask = SIZE ^ 0xA3F1C2B4`.
- Because SIZE varies per packet, the masked magic value is different on every transmission and no longer matchable by a static byte pattern.
- The teamserver reverses the mask before parsing. Both sides derive the same mask independently from the SIZE field alone — no additional key material is required.

#### Per-Request Random AES IV (HVC-004)

- Previously, all beacon packets were encrypted with the same static AES-CTR IV embedded in the Demon binary. Reuse of the same keystream allows an observer to XOR two captured ciphertexts and recover plaintext differences.
- A fresh 16-byte random IV is now generated for every `PackageTransmitAll` call using `RandomNumber32()`. The IV is prepended in plaintext between the outer header and the encrypted payload so the teamserver can extract it.
- The registration packet (`DEMON_INITIALIZE`) continues to use the compiled-in IV; only post-registration beacon packets use per-request IVs.

#### HMAC-SHA256 Packet Authentication (HVC-006)

- AES-CTR provides confidentiality but not integrity — an attacker who can observe and modify ciphertext can flip bits in a predictable way without knowing the key.
- A 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 tag is now appended to every beacon packet after encryption (encrypt-then-MAC). The tag is computed over the entire wire buffer (SIZE, masked header, random IV, and ciphertext).
- A separate MAC key is derived per session: `HMAC-SHA256(AES_session_key, "mac")`, keeping the authentication key independent from the encryption key.
- The teamserver verifies the tag before parsing any packet fields. Packets with an invalid or missing tag are silently dropped with a fake 404 response.
- A pure-C SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA256 implementation was added to the Demon (`src/crypt/HmacSha256.c`) with no CRT or BCrypt API dependency. All intermediate keying material is wiped from the stack before return.
- Registration packets are not authenticated with HMAC (the session key is not yet established when they arrive at the teamserver).

#### Combined Wire Format

After all transport hardening changes, every beacon POST body has the following structure on the wire:

```
base64(
  [SIZE(4 bytes)]
  [XOR-masked header fields(16 bytes)]
  [random AES IV(16 bytes)]
  [AES-CTR encrypted payload]
  [HMAC-SHA256 tag(32 bytes)]
)
```

### Features

#### Client

> Cross-platform UI written in C++ and Qt5

- Payload builder dialog with profile-driven defaults; per-payload options for sleep obfuscation, proxy loading, AMSI/ETW patch technique, indirect syscalls, auto proxy detection, and more
- Sleep obfuscation option selectability — invalid combinations (e.g. JmpGadget or Stack Duplication with non-timer techniques) are automatically disabled in the builder
- Task queue management commands: `task list`, `task clear`, `task cancel <id|all>`
- TaskID injected into all console output messages so operators can correlate output to specific queued tasks
- File browser, process list, loot vault, and credential manager widgets

> Havoc's flagship agent written in C and x86/x64 ASM

- Sleep obfuscation via [Ekko](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Ekko), Zilean, or [FOLIAGE](https://github.com/SecIdiot/FOLIAGE)
- Sleep obfuscation source split into per-technique files (`ObfTimer.c`, `ObfFoliage.c`) with compile-time `SLEEPOBF_USE_TIMER` / `SLEEPOBF_USE_FOLIAGE` guards — only the selected technique is compiled into the binary

- x64 return address spoofing during indirect syscalls
- Indirect syscalls for `Nt*` APIs with dynamically resolved SSNs
- SMB transport for child agents over named pipes; DNS transport with configurable resolver and chunked query sequence

### Note

Please do not open any issues regarding detection.

The Havoc Framework hasn't been developed to be evasive. Rather it has been designed to be as malleable & modular as possible. Giving the operator the capability to add custom features or modules that evades their targets detection system.
